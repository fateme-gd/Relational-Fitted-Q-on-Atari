* **clauses.txt**: logic clauses of the form *head*:-*body*; with *head* being an action and body, several body predicates.
* **const.txt**: where all the constant types are declared
* **neural_preds.txt**: predicates that are evaluated on the inputs
* **preds.txt**: predicates that correspond to the actions
